This project is ment to serve as an example of how you can integrate a typical
CRM-style web application (CRM, journal etc.) with ExorLive.

It uses OpenID to provide single sign-on and oAuth to provide security - user credentials are NOT shared between the applications.

The sample project requires ASP.NET 3.5 to function and is set up to work against ExorLive's integration platform.

The code is documented and the the application will lead you through setup.
